<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Human-Computer Interaction using hand gesture recognition is a great advancement in technology that makes our life easier and convenient. For any gesture recognition, Hand detection is important that is a pre-processing step. In this project, hand segmentation is done using skin color and motion detection using thresholding. Using a web camera, the hand is segmented and then we can use it in any application. 

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Opencv](https://opencv.org/)
